l-note uses React and Webpack to build the frontend environment, with certain features implemented using packages such as password encryption and SPA. Unpublished data is stored in local storage, while published notes are stored in the cloud database, firestore. Webpack and other plugins sourced from the community are utilized to address cross-browser compatibility issues, bundle modules, and optmize the project. For easy component and interface testing, Jest and React Testing Library are employed. Finally, the project is deployed to the internet with using Firebase Hosting.
